# SynBioHub's Documentation

1. **[synbiohub-docs](https://github.com/SynBioHub/synbiohub-docs)**: This repository contains the whole source code for the documentation, including the markdown files as well as the fully rendered version for the website.

2. **[synbiohub.github.io](https://github.com/SynBioHub/synbiohub.github.io)**: This repository contains the fully rendered code for the documentation.

    ## Notes
* There is an option of having a **Read More** box, at the end of each page. Currently this box has been disabled. For disabling this box, insert the following statement, into the *config.toml* file, just below the *params* option:
           
       disableReadmoreNav = true 
           
If in future, the functionality of this **Read More** box increases then simply remove this statement from the config.toml file, to re-enable this button, which shall appear at the bottom of every page in the documentation.
